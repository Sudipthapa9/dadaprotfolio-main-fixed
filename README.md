# Sudip Thapa – Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages and mapped to **sudipthapa9.com.np**.

This is an early version of my portfolio. It is built only with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, so it’s simple and definitely **not the best version yet**. It’s not fully reactive/responsive and still needs more work and maintenance, which I plan to do over time.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure and content
- **CSS3** – Styling and basic layout
- **JavaScript (vanilla)** – Small interactive behaviours
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting
- **Cloudflare** – DNS and domain management

---

## Current Workflow

1. Write and update static HTML pages (`index.html` and other section pages).
2. Style them using CSS files in the `/css` directory.
3. Add simple interactions using `javascript/script.js`.
4. Push changes to the `main` branch.
5. GitHub Pages builds and serves the site, and Cloudflare routes the custom domain.

This workflow is straightforward but not yet optimized for larger changes or complex features.

## Known Limitations

This portfolio is **not** in its final form:

- Not fully **responsive/reactive** on all screen sizes and devices.
- No frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.) or component system.
- No build tooling (bundlers, preprocessors, etc.).
- Code structure and assets still need better organisation and cleanup.
- Performance and accessibility have not been deeply tuned.

In short: it works, but it’s a **basic static site**, not a polished production-level front end.  
There is more to be managed and it will be improved in the future.

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:

- Making the layout fully **responsive** and mobile-friendly.
- Refactoring the structure for better reusability and maintainability.
- Possibly migrating to a modern frontend stack (e.g. React, Next.js, or similar).
- Improving accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation, contrast, etc.).
- Adding more projects, detailed case studies, and a better contact flow.
- Setting up a smoother deployment workflow.

This repository will be updated over time as I learn more and refine both the design and the implementation.
